## [1.0.3] - 12/10/2019

* Implemented ability to choose flat or pointy hex layouts. Defaulting to flat to preserve original functionality.

## [1.0.2] - 03/01/2019

* Fixed a bug that did not allow for the hex grid children to update properly on state change

## [1.0.0] - 01/17/2019

* Packagized this hex grid widget that I have been using in my own projects so other projects and
packages can use it. Provides a highly customizable and performance conscious widget to render 
a list of objects marshaled into a widget as a hex layout.
